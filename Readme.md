# Front-end Boilerplate using Sass and Gulp 4 (php flavor)

### Goals: 
    Save time by creating a boiler-plate for future project endeavors. 
    Allow other devs to see how to gracefully migrate from Gulp 3 -> Gulp 4! 
    
    *  Understand Gulp 4 rich features such as series. 
    *  Understand basic layout of a gulp file 
    *  How to automagically update the browser on new changes 
    *  How to build Sass from CSS 
    *  How to bundle/concate JS and CSS files and move them to a 'production location'
    *  How to automagically include href of the bundled version in your code :) 

### Quickstart:
    1. Clone the repo 
    2. Must have npm /node.js installed 
    3. Also for php flavor - install the php (I'm running PHP 7.4.2)


Prerequistes:
    1. Basic understanding of client/browser model (will be using localhost)
    2. Basic understanding of why you would need a bundle/bundeling versions/minification of css/js
    3. Basic understanding of how/when javascript/css is called from client
